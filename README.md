# <Horiseon Accessible Homepage>

## Description

This project is a mock homepage for an online marketing company. The point of this project is to learn to refactor code to be more easily read by developers, as well as increase accessibility for users. I learned how important it is to make code easily readable, as well as the importance of accessibility, not only for user but for search engine optimization. I also learned strategies to increase accessibility for developers and users.
